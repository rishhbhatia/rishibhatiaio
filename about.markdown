I'm a Data Scientist / Engineer based out of San Francisco and on a mission to build products with data at their core. Currently applying my data intuition and building skills to the problem space of consumer Augmented Reality, platforms, cloud compute and relevance/recommendation systems.

Prior backround in tech consulting, quant research, and marketing analytics.

When my laptop is closed, I'm out strength training, swimming, snowboarding and my favorite - having 1:1 conversations with people I find extremely fascinating in cafes all over SF.
